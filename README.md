# 🧠 AI Logic Formulas (base)

TsunamiSense uses an internal function `waveImpactModel()` that generates dynamic data to emulate AI pattern recognition. The simulation mimics wallet flow, contract heat, and risk flags without relying on real-time APIs.

### 🔢 `tsunamiScoreAI(volume, liquidity, volatility)`
> Calculates a dynamic risk-adjusted score for a token.  
> High volume and liquidity increase the score; high volatility penalizes it.
```javascript
function tsunamiScoreAI(volume, liquidity, volatility) {
  const base = (volume + liquidity) / 2;
  const volatilityPenalty = volatility * 1.7;
  const score = Math.floor((base / 1000) - volatilityPenalty);
  return Math.max(5, Math.min(score, 100));
}
```

### 🔢 `interpretVolatility(volatility)`
> Converts a raw volatility value into a human-readable category (Low / Moderate / High).
```javascript
function interpretVolatility(volatility) {
  if (volatility > 20) return `High | ${volatility.toFixed(1)}%`;
  if (volatility > 12) return `Moderate | ${volatility.toFixed(1)}%`;
  return `Low | ${volatility.toFixed(1)}%`;
}
```


### 🔢 `generateVolumeLevel()`
> Simulates token volume using sinusoidal variation based on time.
```javascript
function generateVolumeLevel() {
  return Math.floor(100000 + Math.sin(Date.now() / 50000) * 80000);
}
```

### 🔢 `generateLiquidityEstimate(volume)`
> Estimates liquidity based on volume with added cosine-based fluctuation.
```javascript
function generateLiquidityEstimate(volume) {
  const spread = (volume * 0.6) + (Math.cos(Date.now() / 40000) * 30000);
  return Math.floor(Math.max(spread, 20000));
}
```

### 🔢 `calculateVolatility(volume, liquidity)`
> Calculates volatility as the ratio between the absolute volume-liquidity difference and their total.
```javascript
function calculateVolatility(volume, liquidity) {
  const ratio = Math.abs(volume - liquidity) / (volume + 1);
  return Math.min(ratio * 100, 100);
}
```
