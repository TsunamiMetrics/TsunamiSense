## 🌊 TsunamiSense Roadmap

Stay tuned — we’re building the most intuitive AI-powered memecoin radar on the planet. Here's what's coming next:

### ✅ Completed / MVP now
- Tsunami Score with smart formula based on volume, liquidity & volatility  
- Interactive Chrome Extension UI  
- Internal AI function (`waveImpactModel()`) — no APIs  
- GitHub repository with full code & documentation  
- Visual mock interface + branding assets  
- Manual token input & simulated analysis flow  

### 🔍 Advanced Metrics & Analytics
- Historical **Tsunami Score** & **Risk Profile** trends  
- Early Pump pattern recognition based on price/volume behavior  
- (Optional) NFT activity tracking for related tokens  

### 📈 Interactive Visualization
- Live token chart with price & volume in real-time  
- Heatmap of recent "tsunami spikes" over 24h  
- Animated “wave” effect when major pumps are detected  

### 🔔 Alerts & Automation
- Notifications for high-impact events (e.g. +300% pump, new token surge)  
- Customizable alerts based on token parameters (volume, score, risk)  

### 🤝 Integrations & Extensions
- Telegram bot integration for real-time alerts  
- TradingView webhook support  
- Developer API access for custom dashboards  

### 🧠 AI Features (Coming Soon)
- AI-generated token summaries (volatility, risk, notable wallets)  
- Predictive Early Pump scoring powered by historical patterns  

### 🎮 Gamification
- Leaderboard for users who catch the biggest pumps  
- Simulated pump-trading challenges  

### 🛡️ Security & Education
- "Red Flag" detection for potential scam tokens  
- Built-in onboarding & micro-learning tips for each feature

## 🧠 AI Logic

TsunamiSense uses an internal function `waveImpactModel()` that generates dynamic data to emulate AI pattern recognition. The simulation mimics wallet flow, contract heat, and risk flags without relying on real-time APIs.

### 🔢 `tsunamiScoreAI(volume, liquidity, volatility)`
> Calculates a dynamic risk-adjusted score for a token.  
> High volume and liquidity increase the score; high volatility penalizes it.

function tsunamiScoreAI(volume, liquidity, volatility) {
  const base = (volume + liquidity) / 2;
  const volatilityPenalty = volatility * 1.7;
  const score = Math.floor((base / 1000) - volatilityPenalty);
  return Math.max(5, Math.min(score, 100));
}

### 🔢 `interpretVolatility(volatility)`
> Converts a raw volatility value into a human-readable category (Low / Moderate / High).

function interpretVolatility(volatility) {
  if (volatility > 20) return `High | ${volatility.toFixed(1)}%`;
  if (volatility > 12) return `Moderate | ${volatility.toFixed(1)}%`;
  return `Low | ${volatility.toFixed(1)}%`;
}


### 🔢 `generateVolumeLevel()`
> Simulates token volume using sinusoidal variation based on time.

function generateVolumeLevel() {
  return Math.floor(100000 + Math.sin(Date.now() / 50000) * 80000);
}

### 🔢 `generateLiquidityEstimate(volume)`
> Estimates liquidity based on volume with added cosine-based fluctuation.

function generateLiquidityEstimate(volume) {
  const spread = (volume * 0.6) + (Math.cos(Date.now() / 40000) * 30000);
  return Math.floor(Math.max(spread, 20000));
}

### 🔢 `calculateVolatility(volume, liquidity)`
> Calculates volatility as the ratio between the absolute volume-liquidity difference and their total.

function calculateVolatility(volume, liquidity) {
  const ratio = Math.abs(volume - liquidity) / (volume + 1);
  return Math.min(ratio * 100, 100);
}
