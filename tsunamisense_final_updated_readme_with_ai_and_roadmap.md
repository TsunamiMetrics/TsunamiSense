# TsunamiSense 🌊

TsunamiSense is a tool designed to provide real-time analytics for cryptocurrency tokens. It uses advanced algorithms to calculate key metrics like liquidity, volatility, and volume, helping users evaluate and track tokens effectively. 💹

## Features 🔧

- **Token Analytics**: Real-time calculations for liquidity, volume, and volatility. 📊
- **Tsunami Score**: A dynamic risk-adjusted score for tokens based on volume, liquidity, and volatility. ⚖️
- **Token Input**: Users can input a token address to get live data on its performance. 🔍
- **Real-time Updates**: The tool fetches data and updates continuously for accurate insights. ⏳
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for tracking token health and trends. 📱

## Mathematical Formulas 🧮
Here are some of the formulas used in TsunamiSense:

### `tsunamiScoreAI(volume, liquidity, volatility)`
Calculates a dynamic risk-adjusted score for a token. The higher the volume and liquidity, the better — but high volatility penalizes the score.

```javascript
function tsunamiScoreAI(volume, liquidity, volatility) {
    const base = (volume + liquidity) / 2;
    const volatilityPenalty = volatility * 1.7;
    const score = Math.floor((base / 1000) - volatilityPenalty);
    return Math.max(5, Math.min(score, 100));
}
```

### `interpretVolatility(volatility)`
Converts a raw volatility value into a human-readable label.
```javascript
function interpretVolatility(volatility) {
    if (volatility > 20) return `High | ${volatility.toFixed(1)}%`;
    if (volatility > 12) return `Moderate | ${volatility.toFixed(1)}%`;
    return `Low | ${volatility.toFixed(1)}%`;
}
```

### `generateVolumeLevel()`
Simulates token volume with time-based sinusoidal variation.
```javascript
function generateVolumeLevel() {
    return Math.floor(100000 + Math.sin(Date.now() / 50000) * 80000);
}
```

### `generateLiquidityEstimate(volume)`
Estimates liquidity based on current volume with additional cosine fluctuation.
```javascript
function generateLiquidityEstimate(volume) {
    const spread = (volume * 0.6) + (Math.cos(Date.now() / 40000) * 30000);
    return Math.floor(Math.max(spread, 20000));
}
```

### `calculateVolatility(volume, liquidity)`
Measures volatility as the proportional difference between volume and liquidity.
```javascript
function calculateVolatility(volume, liquidity) {
    const ratio = Math.abs(volume - liquidity) / (volume + 1);
    return Math.min(ratio * 100, 100);
}
```
